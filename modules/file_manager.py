        Performs read or write operations on a JSON file.

        This method handles both reading and writing JSON data to files, with built-in
        error handling for common file operations. If reading a non-existent file and
        a payload is provided, it will create the file with the payload data.

        Args:
            filename (str): The path to the file to operate on.
            mode (str): The file mode ('r' for read, 'w' for write).
            payload (dict, optional): The data to write to the file. Required for write operations.

        Returns:
            dict: The JSON data read from the file, or the payload if creating a new file.
            None if an error occurs during the operation.

        Raises:
            FileNotFoundError: If the file doesn't exist and no payload is provided for read mode.
            json.JSONDecodeError: If the file contains invalid JSON.
            Exception: For any other errors during file operations.

        Examples:
            >>> file_manager = FileManager()
            >>> # Reading a file
            >>> data = file_manager.operation('data.json', 'r')
