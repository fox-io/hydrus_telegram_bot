# Telegram Yiff Bot

## About
Posts images to a Telegram channel from a Telegram bot.

## Usage
Start by cloning the repo into your desired folder.

1. Copy config.json.example to config.json and enter your information into this file.
2. Copy data.json.example to data.json. You do not need to make changes to this file.

Send images as files to your bot's chat. You can include source URLs in the caption (one per line), and they will be parsed to buttons below the image post. Subreddits are parsed from Reddit URLs.
